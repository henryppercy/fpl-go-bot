# Fantasy Premier League Go Bot

A Go-based application designed to retrieve, format, and send Fantasy Premier League standings to your WhatsApp. This simple tool transforms raw league data into an easy-to-read and fun format, providing quick updates directly to your league group chat.

## Current Features
- **Command Line Interface**: Accessible via command line by suppling the league ID as an argument.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Sends a formatted version of an FPL table directly to any specified WhatsApp contact or group.
- **Detailed Standings**: Includes teams, current positions, total points, and recent movements in the league standings.

## Future Plans
This is a work in progress, so in future I plan to add:
- **Automated Updates**: Implementing a cron job to send regular updates, ensuring you never miss the latest standings.
- **Diverse Hosting Options**: Plans to support various hosting solutions to enhance accessibility and ease of use.
- **Expanded Notification Methods**: Beyond WhatsApp, future integrations may include email, text messages, Twitter updates, and more.
- **Live Scoring**: Get live scoring updates during gameweeks for your chosen teams.
- **User-Friendly Frontend**: Frontend interface for easy configuration and settings management.
- **Actual Documentation**: Something a lot better than this.
