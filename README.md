# Fantasy Premier League Go Bot

A Go-based application designed to retrieve, format, and send Fantasy Premier League standings to your Discord channel. This simple tool transforms raw league data into an easy-to-read and fun format, providing quick updates directly to your league channel.

## Current Features
- **Command Line Interface**: Accessible via command line by suppling the league ID as an argument.
- **Discord Integration**: Sends a formatted version of an FPL table directly to any specified Discord channel.
- **Detailed Standings**: Includes teams, current positions, total points, and recent movements in the league standings.
- **Automated Updates**: Utilises a cron job to send regular updates.
- **Docker Integration**: Containerises the application for easier deployment and management.

## Future Plans
This is a work in progress, so in future I plan to add:
- **Expanded Notification Methods**: Beyond Discord, future integrations may include email, text messages, Twitter updates, and more.
- **Live Scoring**: Get live scoring updates during gameweeks for your chosen teams.
- **User-Friendly Frontend**: Frontend interface for easy configuration and settings management.
- **Actual Documentation**: Something a lot better than this.
